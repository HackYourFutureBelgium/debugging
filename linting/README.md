# Linting

These exercises each focus on one important rule from the ESLint configuration
in this repository. There are many more rules than this, it's just enough to
give you an idea of how to fix linting issues in JS.

Using the feedback from the `[eslint]` button see if you can rewrite the code to
behave the same, without having any linting errors.

There are many more rules! You can read about them all at
