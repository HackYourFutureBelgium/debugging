## Study Tips

- Don't rush, understand! Programming is hard.
  - The examples and exercises will still be there to study later.
  - It's better to fail tests slowly and learn from your mistakes than to pass tests quickly and not understand why.
- Don't skip the examples! Understanding and experimenting with working code is a very effective way to learn programming.
- Practice Pair Programming: two people, one computer.
- Read the code out loud
- Take a look through the [HYF Study Tips](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/study-tips) for more inspiration

### Priorities

If you can't finish all the material in this repository, that's expected! Anything you don't finish now will always be waiting for you to review when you need it. These 3 emoji's will help you prioritize your study time and to measure your progress:

- ü•ö `:egg:` - Understanding this material is required, it covers the base skills you'll need for this module and the next. You do not need to finish all of them but should feel comfortable that you could with enough time.
- üê£ `:hatching_chick:` - Do your best to start this material. you don't need to master it or finish it but getting the main idea will be helpful for taking the next steps.
- üê• `:hatched_chick:` - Have you finished all the ü•ö's and started all the üê£'s? push yourself with these challenges.

### Hashtags

There's sooo many examples and exercises in this repository, it's easy to forget of what you still need to finish or what you want to review again. Luckily VSCode is really good at searching through folders of code.

You can write hashtags in your comments while you're studying, then search for those hashtags later so you don't miss anything. Here's some ideas:

- `// #not-done, still a few blanks left` - search for `#not-done` in VScode to find all the exercises you've started and not finished
- `// coercion is confusing, #review this again next week` - search for `#review` to find the files you need to study again
- ... anything goes! Find the hashtags that work for you

## Learning Objectives

What can you expect to learn in this module?

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>

### Programming Skills

- [Learning from Code](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/learning/learning-from-code)
  - Reading & understanding source code
  - Making small, incremental experiments
  - Copying & modifying others' code
- Tracing Program Execution
  - Stepping through code with JS Tutor, DevTools & VSC debugger
  - Tracing values manually with pencil & paper
  - Using the `debugger` statement & break points to explore your code
- Using `console.assert` for small inline tests
  - Learn to _predict_ what _will happen_ using `console.assert`
  - Instead of only _describing_ what _did happen_ using `console.log`
- Debugging:
  - Bugs are when you don't understand what your code is doing, not when your code doesn't understand what you want it to do! The computer is always right :)
  - Identify the line(s) of code that are not doing what you expect
  - Find several other ways of writing that line
  - Replace with the one that works and that you understand best
- Errors:
  - _Syntax vs. Semantic_: Some errors happen because you wrote JavaScript that the interpreter couldn't interpret (syntax), other errors happen when you try to do something that isn't allowed (semantic).
  - _Creation vs. Execution_: Some errors are thrown before the program actually becomes a process (creation phase), others are thrown during program execution when a line of code is reached (execution phase).

### Isolating JavaScript

- Primitives Types & Strict Comparison
  - _types_: find the type of a primitive using `typeof`
  - _strict comparison_: compare the type _and_ value of two primitives using `===` & `!==`
  - _explicit coercion_: casting between primitive types
- Explicit Type Coercion
  - `Boolean`, `String`, `Number`
- Operators & Comparisons
  - `===`, `!==`
  - `isNaN` and `Number.isNaN`
  - `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
  - `&&`, `||`, `??`, `!`
  - `x++`, `++x`, `x--`, `--x`
  - `+`, `*`, `/`, `-`, `%`
  - `x ? y : z`
- Variables:
  - `let` & `const`
  - Declaration, Assignment & Re-Assignment.
  - Block Scope
- Functions
  - `() => {}`:
  - Declaring vs. Calling
  - Arguments vs. Parameters
  - Return Values
  - Lexical scope
- Control Flow
  - Conditionals
  - Loops
  - `break`, `continue`
- `prompt`, `alert`, and `confirm`
  - Validating user input
  - Providing helpful feedback

### Debugging Skills

- `console.log`
  - Printing values to understand what _did_ happen in your code
  - _Always print the **type** AND the **value**_
- `console.assert`
  - Asserting values to _predict_ what will happen in your code
  - Practice how to use all comparison operators to assert values in memory
- Stepping through code execution
  - Using debugging tools to execute your code one step at a time
  - Predict which line of code will execute next
  - Explain and understand how each line of code changes what is in memory
  - Predict what will change in memory after each step of execution
- The `debugger` statement
- Using professional JS debugging tools
  - Browser Debugger
  - VSCode Debugger
- Using learning-focused debugging tools
  - JS Tutor

### JS Program Life-Cycle:

1. _Source code_: The `.js` text file you write. These are just instructions saved as text in your computer, not a live process (a process is an active instance of a program)!
2. _Creation Phase_: When the JavaScript interpreter first reads your instructions from the program. At this point it will load the program into memory (thus making a process) and check for some types of errors.
3. _Execution Phase_: This is the real deal! The JavaScript interpreter will now step through your instructions _one line at a time_, updating the (process) memory according to your instructions.

### Integrating JavaScript

- Document Life-Cycle
  - `<head>`: Scripts & styles are loaded top to bottom, before the `<body>`
  - `<body>`: Everything is executed/loaded top to bottom
- Event-Driven Programming (Handling user input)
  - HTML `onclick` attribute
  - well-organized source files

## Week 1

Use debuggers to step through your code one instruction at a time. Along the way you'll see how to visualize _program memory_, describe errors in your code, and start fixing bugs in a program.

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>
<br>

### Before Class

You don't need to understand this material perfectly, it's just important you aren't seeing it for the first time in class on Sunday.

- [./strict-mode](./strict-mode) (a quick read)
- [./stepping-through](./stepping-through)
  - skim these videos: [part 1](https://vimeo.com/530235541), [part 2](https://vimeo.com/530238311)
- [./isolate](./isolate): Variables
  - so you're familiar with `const` vs. `let`

### During Class

#### Before Break

Dig deeper into program execution and the debugger:

- [./stepping-through](./stepping-through)
- [./fixing-errors](./fixing-errors)

#### After Break

A method for finding and fixing bugs in your code

- [./fixing-bugs](./fixing-bugs)

### After Class

Learning to program with JavaScript is a marathon. This week you can keep working through your favorite tutorials, and be sure make time to get comfortable stepping through and predicting small programs in your debugger. Try starting with:

- ü•ö [./strict-mode](./strict-mode): a quick read
- **Skills**: you're not expected to master these skills in one week, but starting to practice the them in week 1 will make everything else easier. Practicing a little bit every day is the best way to build a skill.
  - ü•ö [./stepping-through](./stepping-through)
  - ü•ö [./fixing-errors](./fixing-errors)
  - ü•ö [./logging](./logging)
  - üê£ [./fixing-bugs](./fixing-bugs)
- **Practice**
  - üê£ [./isolate](./isolate): through conditionals
    - you're not expected to master coercion or operator precedence this week, but you should start them
  - üê£ [./integrate](./integrate): through conditionals

Isolate goes in depth on type coercion and primitive operators. You aren't expected to master these topics in one week, it will take lots of practice for this to sink in.

Study together! Working in small groups and taking turns to predict and explain what is happening with the code is a nice way to spend a few hours. Teaching is a great way to learn.

Your class repository has a folder called `/javascript` and a project board for tracking your issues & PRs. Over the next four weeks you and your classmates will start your own JS Study Guide. This is just the start! Learning JS is a never-ending story, you will keep building this study guide for the rest of your time at HYF.

## Week 3

Learn to trace function execution, and to use function in small programs.

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>
<br>

### Before Class

The examples and exercises in this repository all use `() => {}` functions, while many resources online cover `function` functions. This repository focuses on arrow functions because:

- the syntax is cleaner and less distracting to read
- `this` and `arguments` are less distracting with arrow functions (more on those things later)
- function expressions are easier to study in the debugger since they are not hoisted

Prep work:

- [Functions in 90 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY182o4J5_Y)
- [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/function-basics)
- Coding Train:
  - [Function Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHAitGzBrg)
  - [Parameters & Arguments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkc417YapfE)
  - [Functions & Return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRnUBiTJ66Y)
- Examples
  - [./isolate](./isolate): functions, the basics

### During Class

#### Before Break

- [./isolate](./isolate):
  - `/documenting-functions`
  - `/passing-tests`

#### After Break

- [./using-functions](./using-functions)
  - `/refactor-logic`

### After Class

Keep working your way through your favorite tutorials and the exercises in this repository. If you haven't already, take a look at:

- **Skills**: keep practicing all those coding skills
- **Practice**
  - ü•ö [./isolate](./isolate): through The Callstack
  - üê£ [./fixing-bugs](./fixing-bugs): through Functions
  - üê£ [./using-functions](./using-functions): through Refactor Logic

Try make at least one contribution per week to the class `/javascript` study guide. It doesn't need to be anything fancy! Reviewing a PR or adding a new link is helpful.

## Week 4

Reference vs. Value! This week you will learn about arrays, objects and side-effects.

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>
<br>

### Before Class

This week's class will focus almost entirely on how arrays/objects are stored in memory, and how to use them as arguments to functions. Take a look through the examples in these folders to be ready for class:

- [./isolate](./isolate): reference vs. value, side-effects
- references
  - [Academind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ooYYRLdg_g)
  - [Mosh video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD0t_DKREbE)
  - [CodeBurst article](https://codeburst.io/javascript-passing-by-value-vs-reference-explained-in-plain-english-8d00fd06a47c)

### During Class

#### Before Break

- [./isolate](./isolate): reference vs. value

#### After Break

- [./isolate](./isolate): side-effects

### After Class

- ü•ö [./isolate](./isolate): through Side Effects. Reference vs. Value and Side Effects are another "invisible" thing about JS, you can't see it in the source code! You need to understand how JS program memory works and to learn how debugging tools can help you see this
- üê£ [./fixing-bugs](./fixing-bugs): Arrays & Objects
- üê£ [./integrate](./integrate): Arrays
- üê£ [./using-functions](./using-functions): Avoid Side-Effects

Keep working through your favorite tutorials and the exercises in this repository. It's important to come prepared for the first Sunday of Behavior, Strategy, Implementation so be sure to make time for the prep work!

Try make at least one contribution per week to the class `/javascript` study guide. It doesn't need to be anything fancy! Reviewing a PR or adding a new link is helpful.
