/* User Paths

  the previous examples were boring, the user just did what you said (or not)

  but what if the user had more than one option?

  and what if they could choose their own path through your program?

  then you just might have a game

  try predicting how this game works just by reading the code
    how many prompts are there?
    how many choices does each user have?
    how many paths are there total?
    how would you draw a diagram of this game?

  (this example is very long, you aren't expected to write something like this just yet)
