# For Loops

`for` loops are used to iterate a specific number of times. Perhaps a specific number of times (maybe `5`), or once for each item in your data (each character in a string, or each entry in an array).

## Anatomy of a for loop

How are [the three parts of for loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/statements/for) conventionally used?

```js
for (initialization; condition; finalExpression) {
  // ... loop body ...
}
```

1. declare a variable, update the variable, check a condition.
2. declare a variable, check a condition, update the variable.
3. check a condition, update the variable, declare a variable.
4. check a condition, declare a variable, update the variable.

The correct answer is `2`.

```js
for (
  // 2: declare and assign the `step` variable
  let step = 0; // initialization
  // 3, 6, 9, 12: check if `step` is less than 3
  step < 3; // condition
  // 5, 8, 11: add 1 to `step`
  step++ // finalExpression
) {
  // 4, 7, 10: log the current value of `step`
  console.log(step);
}
```

### `while` to `for`

Another good way to understand how `for` loops work is to compare them to a while loop that increments a stepper variable.

Notice how `stepWhile` and `stepFor` are scoped differently in your debugger or Js Tutor. `stepWhile` is available to the entire script, `stepFor` is only available inside the for loop:

```js
// these two loops will behave the same
// which do you find easier to read?

let maximum = 3;

let stepWhile = 0;
while (stepWhile < maximum) {
  console.log('stepWhile:', stepWhile);
  stepWhile++;
}

for (let stepFor = 0; stepFor < maximum; stepFor++) {
  console.log('stepFor:', stepFor);
}
```

## Use Cases

### Stepping Up

Stepper Variables change systematically, going through a series of values to manage control flow. "Stepper" describes how you are using a variable. This term is not a JavaScript thing, it's a general programming concept.

Using a stepper variable in a loop is such a common use case that the `for` loop was designed to make it part of the language.

```js
'use strict';

const toRepeat = 'howdy';

let totalRepetitions = 4;

let repeatedString = '';

for (let i = 0; i < totalRepetitions; i++) {
  repeatedString += toRepeat;
  console.log('repeatedString:', repeatedString);
}

console.assert(
  repeatedString === 'howdyhowdyhowdyhowdy',
  '"howdy" should be repeated 4 times'
);
```

## Exercises

<details>
<summary>reverse a string</summary>

```js
// reverse a string

let originalString = 'jklm';
console.log('originalString:', originalString);

let reversedString = '';
console.log('reversedString:', reversedString);

for (_; _; _) {
  let nextLetter = _;
  reversedString = _ + _;
  console.log('reversedString:', reversedString);
}

console.assert(
  reversedString === 'mlkj',
  'reversed string is the original reversed'
);
```
