# Comparisons

In these examples and exercises, you will be studying how JavaScript works when comparing different types. You should _always avoid this_ in your own programs. The code in this folder is to help you understand how JavaScript works, not to show best practices

## Welcome to Implicit Coercion!

This is among the most confusing features of JS. Some developers like it, more developers don't. Sometimes it's helpful, usually it causes problems But it's not magic, you can learn it!

The keys to understanding Implicit Coercion are:

0. pay attention to the type of every value in your program (!!!! always !!!!)
1. understand the rules of explicit coercion (String(x), Number(x), Boolean(x), ...)
1. learn the rules for how each JS operator coerces types "behind the scenes"

Each operator has it's own rules for how it handles implicit coercion. There are a lot of implicit coercion rules to learn but at the bottom of it all, implicit coercion is just that

- rules you can study
- rules you can learn
