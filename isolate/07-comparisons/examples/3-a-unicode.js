/* Unicode & .charCodeAt()

  before moving on to comparisons you should be familiar with Unicode
  Unicode is a convention that connects each character on your screen to a number
  here are some examples:
  - 'e' is represented by 101
  - '#' is represented by 35
  - '2' is represented by 50
  - ... https://unicode-table.com/en/

  JavaScript uses the Unicode convention behind the scenes to process string data
  usually you won't need to think about this
  but when comparing strings, you must know about it

  when JavaScript compares strings, it doesn't use alphabetical order
  it compares the unicode values for characters

// the .charCodeAt() method will tell you the number of a character
// you'll need to keep this in mind to understand the next files

const e = 'e';
const eUnicodeNumber = e.charCodeAt();
console.log(typeof e, e, '->', typeof eUnicodeNumber, eUnicodeNumber);

const hashtag = '#';
const hashtagUnicodeNumber = hashtag.charCodeAt();
console.log(
  typeof hashtag,
  hashtag,
  '->',
  typeof hashtagUnicodeNumber,
  hashtagUnicodeNumber,
);

const two = '2';
const twoUnicodeNumber = two.charCodeAt();
console.log(typeof two, two, '->', typeof twoUnicodeNumber, twoUnicodeNumber);

const space = ' ';
const spaceUnicodeNumber = space.charCodeAt();
console.log(
  typeof space,
  space,
  '->',
  typeof spaceUnicodeNumber,
  spaceUnicodeNumber,
);

console.log('-- end --');
